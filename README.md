# SteemIt-Blog-Posts
I keep all my steemit blog posts here, or at least the edited Markdown, so view my raw work here before they hit the Steemit blockchain.


## Here are all my unedited and rough drafts. 
In this repository, feel free to take a look at posts before they hit the blockchain; I figure the best way to produce good content is to actually have an editor to write in, and then have different commits for the different drafts, and only submit the final one to steemit.  
## Suggestions Welcome
Feel free to put your suggestions up here. Please. The more the merrier.
